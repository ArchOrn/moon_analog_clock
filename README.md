# Moon Analog Clock

A clock for the *Flutter Clock* contest.
It clock consists of 12 'moons' that get filled (i.e. the become darker) along with the passing hours
In dark mode, the moons rather get filled by becoming 'full moons'.
The hour can be read by counting the filled moons (the number of hours) and by guessing the minutes
watching the moon crescent of the filling moon.
The clock also displays the temperature at the bottom, converted if necessary in Farenheit.
It comes with two themes : light and dark. The them changes with respect to the current brightness.
